# 👨‍💻 VS Code Style Portfolio

A unique, developer-centric personal portfolio designed to mimic the standard **Visual Studio Code** interface. This project showcases personal information in a creative way—represented as a JavaScript object within a code editor environment.

## ✨ Features

- **Code Editor UI**: A realistic simulation of the VS Code interface including sidebar, tab bar, status bar, and file explorer.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Personal data is presented as code with proper syntax coloring for strings, numbers, properties, and comments.
- **Responsive Layout**:
  - **Desktop**: Features a floating, interactive "Preview Card" that follows your mouse cursor slightly.
  - **Mobile**: Optimizes the layout by moving the profile card to a fixed position at the bottom and providing a clean, full-screen coding experience.
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle entrance animations and hover effects.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling (Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables) for the theme and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Handling typing effects and interactive mouse movements for the 3D card effect.
- **FontAwesome**: For the icons used in the sidebar and social links.
- **Google Fonts**: Uses 'Fira Code' for the coding area and 'Inter' for the UI elements.
